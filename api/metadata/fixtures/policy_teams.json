This involves making sure that there are adequate anti-trust laws in place to effectively regulate competition. Examples of barriers in this area include anti-competitive collusion and price fixing between firms (cartels), abuse of dominant market monopolies and anti-competitive mergers."

Central concerns within the IP space include difficulty acquiring new and protecting existing IP rights (eligibility and maintenance), conditions under which IP rights will no longer be recognised (exhaustion), and a lack of legal procedures to deal with the infringement of IP rights (enforcement). Other issues include forced-technology transfer in exchange for market access and regulations limiting the deployment of brand representation."

Investment barriers are mainly discriminatory treatment of foreign investors – through restrictions and requirements. For example, equity caps, joint venture requirements, limitations on movement of capital, and restrictive investment screening processes. However, barriers can also take an administrative nature, for instance a lack of transparent investment regulations, or slow or unfair investment authorisation procedures."

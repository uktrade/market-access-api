# Market Access API


Market Access API provides an API into Market Access frontend clients.

## Installation with Docker (preferred)

Market Access API uses Docker compose to setup and run all the necessary components. The docker-compose.yml file provided is meant to be used for running tests and development.

#### Prerequisites
1. Install `docker` & `docker compose` - https://docs.docker.com/install/
2. Add the following to your `hosts` file:

        # Market Access API
        127.0.0.1               api.market-access.local
3. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/uktrade/market-access-api
    cd market-access-api
    ```
4. Copy the env file - `cp docker-compose.local-template.env docker-compose.env`         

#### Install
1. Build the images and spin up the containers by running - `docker-compose up --build`
2. Set up git hooks by running - `make git-hooks`
3. Enter bash within the django container using `docker-compose exec web bash`  
then create a superuser `py3 manage.py createsuperuser --email your@email.here`
4. To start the dev server run - `make django-run`
5. The API is now accessible via http://api.market-access.local:8880

#### Running in detached mode
The installation steps above will require 2 terminal windows to be open to run the processes.
If desired this can be reduced to 0 via the following commands:
1. Start the containers in detached mode - `docker-compose up -d`
2. Start django in detached mode - `make django-run-detached`
3. The API is now accessible via http://api.market-access.local:8880

Now even if you closed your terminal, the server would be still running.

#### Make commands
There's a set of make commands that you can utilize straight away. \
To list all available commands with help text type `make help` in terminal and hit `Enter`.

## Native installation (without Docker)

Dependencies:

-   Python 3.7
-   PostgreSQL 10
-   redis 3.2

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/uktrade/market-access-api
    cd market-access-api
    ```

2.  Install Python 3.7.
    
    [See this guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/) for detailed instructions for different platforms.

3.  Create and activate the virtualenv:

    ```shell
    python3.7 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    ```

4.  Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  Create an `.env` settings file (itâ€™s gitignored by default):

    ```shell
    cp config/sample.env .env
    ```
The user authentication is handled by the [DIT SSO](https://github.com/uktrade/staff-sso) where a token is stored and used for introspection of user and other end points. You can run a [mock-sso](https://github.com/uktrade/mock-sso) client to run the app near a produciton mode without the hastle of logging in. Configure your `.env` file accordingly.

There are some machine to machine APIs that are called on the backend and we use [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk) to secure those calls. You can share Hawk Key and ID with frontend to work in hawk mode. Alternatively, in dev mode, you can turn off Hawk using the `.env` settings.

6.  Create the db. By default, the dev version uses postgres:

    ```shell
    psql -p5432
    create database market_access;
    ```
7. Make sure you have redis running locally and that the REDIS_BASE_URL in your `.env` is up-to-date.

8. Apply migrations:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py migrate
    ```

9.  Create a superuser:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    
8. Start the server:

    ```shell
    ./manage.py runserver
    ```

9. Start celery:

    ```shell
    celery worker -A config -l info -Q celery,long-running -B
    ```

    Note that in production the long-running queue is run in a separate worker with the 
    `-O fair --prefetch-multiplier 1` arguments for better fairness when long-running tasks 
    are running or pending execution.

To run the tests:

```shell
pytest .
```

To run the linter:

```shell
flake8
```

## Granting access to the front end

The [internal front end](https://github.com/uktrade/market-access-frontend) uses single sign-on. You should configure backend API as follows to use with the front end:

* `SSO_ENABLED`: `True`
* `RESOURCE_SERVER_INTROSPECTION_URL`: URL of the [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) introspection endpoint (should be the same server the front end is using). This is provided by a [Staff SSO](https://github.com/uktrade/staff-sso) instance.
* `RESOURCE_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`: Access token for the introspection server.
* `RESOURCE_SERVER_USER_INFO_URL`: URL of SSO endpoint to retreive logged in user information based on token provided in the header
* `RESOURCE_SERVER_USER_INTROSPECT_URL`: URL of SSO endpoint to retrieve user information based on query param

django-oauth-toolkit will create a user corresponding to the token if one does not already exist.

## Machine to machine Hawk authentication between frontend and backend

In general, [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk) authentication hashing the HTTP payload and `Content-Type` header, and using a nonce.

There are some machine to machine APIs that are called on the backend and we use [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk) to secure those calls. You can share Hawk Key and ID with frontend to work in hawk mode. Alternatively, in dev mode, you can turn off Hawk using the `.env` settings.
